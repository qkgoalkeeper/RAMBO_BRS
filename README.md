# RAMBO Fast Processing and Querying of 170TB of Genomics Data via a Repeated And Merged BloOm Filter (RAMBO)
RAMBO is a method to reduce the query cost of sequence search over the archive of dataset files to address the sheer scale and explosive increase of new sequence files.
It solves achives sublinear query time (O(\sqrt{K} log K)) in number of files with memory requirement of slightly more then the information theoretical limit. 

This code is the implementation of:

for gene sequence search.
